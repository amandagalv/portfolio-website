    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>While Generation Z and Millennials are more likely to invest in the stock market today than previous generations, there is a gap in the market for products that ‘speak their language’ and reflect their habits, such as connecting and reaching to others online for support.</p>
    <h3>The Process></h3>
    <p>I worked part time from Dec 2020 – Jun 2021 on a multi-step process (visualised below) that allowed me to explore different stages of a full-cycle project.</p>

    <h2> 1. Emphasise </h2>
    <h3> Competitive Analysis </h3>
    <p>To understand the market around the stock market, I conducted a competitive analysis of Revolut and Reddit. I used the S.W.O.T (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) method which helped me identify gaps in the market and possible concepts ideas for filling them. Further research showed that there is a growing interest in investing among younger generations.</p>

    <h3> User Survey </h3>
    <p>I ran a survey study with participants between 25-40 years old. The survey was a great method to collect data relatively quick.</p>

      <h3>User Interviews</h3>
      <div>
        <p> Participants </p>
        <ul>
          <a <p> 6 participants </p></a>
          <a <p>28-37 years old</p></a>
          <a <p>Familiar with UK online banking platforms</p></a>
        </ul>
        <p>Key Insights</p>
        <div>
          <div><p>Financial Interest</p></div>
          <p>Most non-experts like the idea of using financial tools to grow their savings but they don’t have a personal interest in finance. <br> SOLUTION: A personalised feature can help users to keep updated on the news that matter to their own investments and goals.<p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div><p>Social Habits</p></div>
          <p>Users appreciate and feel more confidant when seeing other investors’ moves, but most users might prefer a private account using nicknames and no photos so that they feel comfortable sharing their experiences. <br> SOLUTION: A social-media feature where investors can exchange ideas while keeping their real identity private can be helpful to users.<p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div><p>Impediment</p></div>
          <p>Users who are not financial experts feel overwhelmed with the excessive amount of technical information. That is often the reason why they give up on investing. <br> SOLUTION: Less technical terms and allowing users to see the acvitity of more experient investors can help new users to feel confident and give them a start point.<p>

      <h2>2. Define</h2>
      <h3> User Personas</h3>
      <p>Based on the findings from my user research, I created two personas, Sara and Matt, to help put focus on the needs and frustations to be addressed. Sara has a spontaneous personality, more risk-friendly and focused on the moment. Matt likes to have a plan and a long-term goal to aim for.</p>

      <h3> User JOurneys</h3>
      <p>To understand better the experience Sara and Matt would have with Pluto and what features could be helpful to them, I created a customer journey map for both.</p>

      <h2>3.Ideate</h2>
      <h3> User Flow</h3>
      <p>With my personas in mind, I mapped out user flows. That enabled me to work out the user paths and functions required to achieve a certain goal, as well as their feeling and expectations through each step.</p>

      <h3> Site Map</h3>
      <p>I created a site map to organise the platform’s hierarchy with its main sections, subdivisions and filters.</p>

      <h3> Wireframes</h3>
      <p>With the site structure set, I started to sketch my first ideas for Pluto’s interface.</p>

      <h2>5.Validade</h2>
      <h3> The Testing Process</h3>
      <p>6 participants, all were:<br>
        <ul>
          <a <p>28-40 years old Familiar </p></a>
          <a <p>Familiar to UK online banking</p></a>
          <a <p>Remotely interviewed using Zoom</p></a>
        </ul>
        <p>Goal:<br>
          <ul>
            <a <p>To observe and test if the app is easy to navigate</p></a>
            <a <p>To observe if the features and buttons felt intuitive and easy to access</p></a>
            <a <p>To know if users understand Pluto’s proposal</p></a>
          </ul>
          <p>After writing and developing a test script, I organised the data in a rainbow spreadsheet, using the Jakob Nielsen method of severity ratings to grade any usability problems.​​​​​​​ I also created an affinity map with the most common comments and observations.</p>

      <h3>Refining the Prototype</h3>
      <p>Using a combination of pen, paper and Figma I gradually elevated the fidelity of my prototypes. Through user testing, preference testing and peer reviews, I had enough data to refine the design. </p>
      <div>
        <h3>01 | Home screen</h3>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/pluto/home-screen@1.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/pluto/home-screen@2.png" alt="Home screen">
        </picture>
        <p>Through comments and ‘thinking out loud observations on the first round of usability test, I noticed that some users found some screens to blend, lacking colour, so I added colours and icons creating a more visually interesting interface but also recognition through the icons. I ran a preference test as I was unsure how to name the screen. 8 of 13 participants preferred the screen to have ‘Pluto’ header instead of ‘Home’.<p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>02 | Stocks</h3>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/pluto/stocks@1.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/pluto/stocks@2.png" alt="Stocks">
        </picture>
        <p>The wireframe had a top header indicating the name of the page, and a ‘go back’ button. <br> On the High-Fidelity Prototypes prototype, the whole platform structure was amended to a more horizontal sitemap. That helped user to locate themselves and reduce the need for too many ‘go back’ clicks.
I achieved this by creating a consistent 3 layer structure for Pluto: Main sections, sub’sections and filter. <br> The bottom tab link the user to the 3 main sections (Home, Feed, Wealth) of the app. The top header shows the name of this section. Below it, buttons take the user to any sub-sections (stocks, savings, groups, etc.) and highlights the current location. On a third row, a side-slide list of filter quicky take the user to specific screens (Trending, My Stocks, Specific groups, etc).</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>03 | Groups</h3>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/pluto/groups@1.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/pluto/groups@2.png" alt="Groups">
        </picture>
        <p>User used to go inside Feed, Groups, My Groups, Chosen Group to read their group threads. On this path, there was no interesting hint or tip such as a trending topic. On the usability testing it was noted by several users that the path didn’t add them any ‘info/surprise’ on the way, feeling unecessarily long. <br>Just as we’ve seen on stocks, on the High-Fidelity Prototype the whole platform structure was amended to a more horizontal sitemap. That helped user to locate themselves and reduced the need for ‘empty’ pages on the user’s path.<p>
      </div>
    </div>

      <h2>6. Refine </h2>
      <h3> Design Documentation</h3>
      <p>After rounds of usability testing and gradually polishing the design, I’m now ready to create a style guide so it’s easier to handle the project over if needed.</p>

    <div>
      <h2>Conclusion </h2>
      <div>
      <h3>Key Findings</h3>
      <p>Research pays off.<br>The feedback and insights from both user reserch and usability testing were an extremely valuable source to show how Pluto could stand out and be more helpful to users. </p>
      <p>Use rules for consistency since the beginning.<br> I used a grid system from the beggining and that was a big time-saver when refining Pluto. For my next projects, I will also set part of the design documentation, such as typography and colour palette, from the beggining so the design evolutes more consistent and there’s less need to refine afterwards. </p>
      <p>Consider Accessibility.<br> It’s important to choosing the typography and interface colours while keeping accessibility in mind.  </p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>With more rounds of usability testing, the Feed feature could be improved and possibly more gamified. More features could be shown to be useful and/or appreciated by users. <br> <br>At some point, a feature for Pension could be added so users have all their financial wealth in one place (savings, pension, investments).</p>
